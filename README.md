MP3TagReadService
=================

A simple web service for getting mp3 tag information from a collection of mp3 by passing the local file location. Project uses Spring, EhCache for controlling how often mp3 files are scanned and JAudioTagger library for reading mp3 files. Jetty is used as a proof of concept for standing up the web-service on the fly.
